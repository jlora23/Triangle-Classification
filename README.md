# Triangle-Classification

This assignment was fun and quite simple which made it enjoyable to learn about testing different cases for a software program. The main challenges I encountered were mainly figuring out how I would classify the different types of triangles. Creating the test cases was quite simple. The requirements specification for this assignment were easy to understand and were helpful for this assignment. I encountered no issues with the tools since I have previous experience using IDLE and Python. The criteria I used to determine each test case was I ensured that each case was working properly. For example, I had a test case to prove each of the different types of triangles were able to be classified given the correct inputs. I also had test cases that had invalid inputs, or inputs that resulted in not having a valid triangle.
